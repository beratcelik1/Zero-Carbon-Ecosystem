            <h6>Carbon token ($ZCARB) was an answer to a simple question.
<br><br>
What would happen if a cryptocurrency project 100% run by its community and used to do good for humanity and save the environment?
<br><br>
While none of us have imagined it at the time, this was the start of a revolution.
<br><br>
In a world ruled by the commodification of time, community-based projects that uses power of decentralization are more than just change of pace, they are a way to practice the radical acceptance of a world without a governmental structure. When success depends on the shared strength of the individual who make up a collective to do good for the world and save the environment from hazardous effects of greenhouse gases and climate change, we are forced to shift our perspectives to align with those around us.
                <br><br>Zero Carbon Ecosystem is our way of recognizing the importance of tearing down a long-established paradigm of a formulaic success and building a path to a sustainable and environmentally friendly ecosystems for our home, earth.
<br><br>
With that thought bright in our minds, we began developing the Zero Carbon Ecosystem in earnest.</h6>

        <h6>Until now, centralization has been a prerequisite for all our official structures. Political, educational, and financial systems are, and have always been, crafted in a way that does not equally and ethically distribute power to those functioning within them. 
<br><br>
Considering the problem from environmental perspective, over the course of the last year, the number of offshore oil rigs in the US has doubled, and the Paris Climate Accord, the source of so much optimism in years past, seems incapable of holding nations to account. While change is happening, it is too slow, marred by private interests and a powerful conservative majority that continues to deny the truth: we are on the edge of disaster.
            <br><br>
Is this the fault of the government? Yes. These are democracies, created to implement our wants and care for our needs. In falling short of this, they have failed in their mandate to serve and uphold the majority will – instead succumbing to the pressure of profit-driven corporations and fringe stakeholders. Beyond the crime of neglecting climate change, governments are failing to safeguard the integrity of democratic life.
<br><br>
“We live in a strange world where children must sacrifice their own education to protest against the destruction of their future. Where the people who have contributed the least to this crisis are the ones who are going to be affected the most.” -Greta Thunberg
<br><br>
Currently, the world is set to exceed and even double the 1.5 degrees temperature threshold  in this lifetime. At this rate, even a 99% commitment to tackling climate change is not enough, and the history already taught us that centralized systems incentivized by capitalist ambitions will not help us. Therefore, we believe that solution lies in the decentralization. 
<br><br>
As the founders of Zero Carbon Ecosystem, we are here to change the status quo, and drive the humanity towards progress in reducing carbon emissions.</h6>

            <h6>Looking at all the other blockchains, you might wonder why $ZCARB Token is on the MATIC network. The reason is that MATIC is one of the most eco-friendly, efficient and scalable blockchains with near to zero carbon emissions using Proof of Stake (PoS) to verify transactions.
<br><br>
As MATIC grows every day, being used by more dApps and dEXs,  it is rising as one of the most used blockchains. MATIC network with its premise is growing in popularity and is widely used throughout the crypto world, allowing Carbon Token to be widely used everywhere and by everyone.</h6>

            <h6>The Intergovernmental Panel released the AR6 WG1 report on Climate Change (IPCC) in August 2021. (The IPCC is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change.) Carbon budget calculations have been adjusted slightly since the previous report of 2018. The residual global carbon budget to remain within 1.5° global warming with 66% probability is given as 400 billion tonnes CO2 from 2020.
<br><br>
According to calculations, this carbon budget will run out in 9 years if countries continue to emit greenhouse gases at the current rate. 
<br><br>
Zero Carbon Ecosystem with a supply of 400.000.000.000 $ZCARB token, each token worth 1000kg (1 ton) of CO2, aiming to be an approximate measurement of the world’s carbon budget.
<br><br>
Apart from gaining its value from the market demand, we aim to use this token to incentivize people to pay for their carbon emissions caused by their daily spending. 
<br><br>
We believe that a decentralized payment system that charges households and firms for their carbon emissions can make them disincentivize to spend the world’s carbon budget, creating an incentive to emit zero-carbon. 
<br><br>
Therefore, we developed a payment system called Carbon Pay that approximately calculates people’s carbon emissions according to their self-report and informs people how much their carbon emission spending is worth in ZCARB token, incentivizing them to pay for their consumption of the world’s carbon budget.</h6>

            <h6> Created as a Chrome Extension, Carbon Pay will make payment of carbon emission fees easier, accessible, and scalable for people. Through the extension, people will be able to buy ZCARB token created in MATIC network, calculating their individual carbon emissions, and learning its value in terms of ZCARB coin, and pay their carbon fees using their ZCARB tokens. 
<br><br>
Each payment made using Carbon Pay will send ZCARB tokens to a burn address with an unknown private key, and take them out of the total supply, which is called “burning” in the crypto ecosystem. 
<br><br>
Carbon Pay system will make our ZCARB token deflationary over time by decreasing the overall supply after each payment and increasing the value of ZCARB token corresponding to US dollars, and disincentivize household and companies to emit more greenhouse gases as carbon budget of the world decreases over time. 
<br><br>
Using Carbon Pay, people will be able to calculate their carbon emissions daily, weekly, and monthly according to their own self-reported data. After tapping to “Pay” button, they will be able to enter their consumptions in three different sections. 
<br><br>
•	House<br><br>
•	Transportation<br><br>
•      Custom<br><br>

Carbon Pay will automatically calculate the carbon footprint of the individual in metric tons of CO2 and display how much the individual should pay for his/her carbon emissions. We aim to increase the accuracy and complexity of calculations in the future, by gathering more data on individuals by collaborating with various companies.</h6>

            <h6>How can we make people pay for their carbon fees which they have not been charged for a long time? The answer to the question lies within the term called Network Effect. With the efficient use of marketing using Environmental NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) such as Greenpeace, Global Footprint Network, Earth Justice etc., we believe that we can be recognized in the media as the beginning of a worldwide revolution of humanity to save the earth from irreversible effects of climate change. Therefore, marketing and activism are a massive part of our Zero Carbon Ecosystem. 
<br><br>
As more and more people use Carbon Pay and ZCARB tokens to pay for their carbon emission fees, we are sure that every person will begin to feel responsible for paying for their carbon fees and disincentivized to emit more while watching the world’s carbon budget running out via our total supply statistics. 
<br><br> 
Moreover, to initiate the spread of this environmental responsibility challenge, we aim to collaborate with various companies such as airlines, natural gas companies, car companies etc., to make using Carbon Pay mandatory for their customers so that they would have to pay the price for their carbon emissions. 
<br><br>
20% of the total supply of ZCARB tokens will also be added to the total supply at a slow pace not to cause a devaluation of the token. Using crypto exchange marketplaces, this will be realized by selling ZCARB tokens for their market value. 75% of the earnings from these sales will be used to subsidize Zero-Carbon emission technologies and support eco-friendly companies financially. The rest, 25 % of the earnings, will be used to increase the quality of our web services, provide security of our platform, afford salaries of our employees, and increase marketing expenses to incentivize people to be part of this decentralized environmental revolution.</h6>
